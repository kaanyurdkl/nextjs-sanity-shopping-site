### 1. Read Core Documentation

```bash
# Essential files to read for complete context:
- CLAUDE.md                         # This file - development guidance
- docs/project-specifications.md    # Complete technical specifications
- design/pages/*.png               # All UI wireframes (home, product, cart, checkout, etc.)
- design/flows/*.png               # User flow diagrams
```

### 2. Review Current Implementation

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Next.js Sanity Shopping Site

**Description**: A sophisticated fashion e-commerce platform showcasing modern full-stack development skills. Built as a portfolio project demonstrating advanced React patterns, headless CMS integration, and professional e-commerce features.

**Scope**: Complete e-commerce solution including product catalog, user authentication, shopping cart, checkout process, order management, and admin content management through Sanity CMS.

**Repository**: https://github.com/kaanyurdkl/nextjs-sanity-shopping-site

## Development Essentials

### Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint checks

### Code Style & Conventions

- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS
- Destructure imports when possible: `import { client } from '../lib'`
- Follow single responsibility principle
- TypeScript strict mode - all types required
- Path aliases: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`

### Development Workflow

- **IMPORTANT**: Always run `npm run lint` before committing code
- **IMPORTANT**: Test schema changes with example data script
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Follow existing patterns in Sanity schemas
- Use TypeScript for all new files

### Tech Stack

- **Core**: Next.js 15.4.1, React 19.1.0, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Sanity CMS
- **Full details**: See `docs/project-specifications.md` â†’ Technical Architecture

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

- Next.js 15 setup with App Router and Turbopack
- Sanity integration with Studio v3
- Product and review schemas with dynamic sizing system
- Example data generation script with JSON separation
- Geist font integration

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

- Creating remaining Sanity schemas (user, order, promotion)
- Frontend component development

### ðŸ“‹ Next Phase

- Complete all content schemas
- Implement authentication (NextAuth.js + Google OAuth)
- Build core e-commerce functionality
